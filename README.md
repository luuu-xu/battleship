# battleship
The Battleship project from The Odin Project.

- This project is the first project I complete with TDD enviornment. The logics behind the battleship game itself is fully TDD, with a bunch of jest tests.

- Then the dom manipulation is as complicated and frustrating as previous projects were, however, I have completed it with a lot of searches and head-scratches. Maybe there are some systems or playbooks of dom manipulation?

- The css style is minimalist in Courier New and simple greyscale palette. I have been using this style for quite a few previous projects and I loved them!
